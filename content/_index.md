i am brandon. i'm a computer science graduate from the university of houston.

i love to learn and solve puzzles. my curiousity leads me to tinker with new tools and technologies. my current interests are linux, zsh, and vim.

i am a beginner and decided to go with linux fedora as it came recommended from a friend. unfortunately, only recently has the idea of free and open-source software captivated me—so down the rabbit hole i go.

zsh (z shell) was also recommended by the same friend. i haven’t used it enough to notice a big difference yet, but customizing it with oh-my-zsh gave me three solid hours of enjoyable procrastination.

vim is a new challenge i've taken on, and i wish i’d started sooner. not using the mouse feels like a layer of friction has disappeared. right now, i’m getting familiar with commands like `b, w, e, 0, $, dd`, and the more i use it, the more efficient i feel.
